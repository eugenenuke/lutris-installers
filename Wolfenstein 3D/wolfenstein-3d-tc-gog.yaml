notes: |
  The Wolfenstein 3D Total Conversion for Doom is designed to be just that... 
  A total conversion of Wolfenstein 3D to the Doom engine.
  The aim has been to recreate the look and feel of Wolfenstein 3D in a more modern 2.5D engine,
  while still preserving the original gameplay, weapons, enemies, etc.
