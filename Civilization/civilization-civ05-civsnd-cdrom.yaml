name: "Sid Meier's Civilization"
game_slug: civilization
version: CDROM
slug: civilization-civ05-civsnd-cdrom
runner: dosbox
year: 1991
notes: |
  This installation script requires you to have the game's CD.

  This version installs CIV.EXE v474.05 patch (latest) and the updated CIVSND
  version of AdLib/SoundBlaster driver, which supports OPL3 (better MIDI and
  stereo sound).

  It's recommended to have fluidsynth configured in your linux system with some
  advanced sound font like "Arachno SoundFont" [1].

  On the game start select:
  - 1) VGA (256 color)
  - 4) AdLib/Sound Blaster
  - 1) Mouse and Keyboard

  Enjoy!
