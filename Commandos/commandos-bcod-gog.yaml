  This version includes a fix for notorious "Insert CD" [1] and
  "Black Screen/No Briefing Videos" [2] issues, as well as an issue with
  scrolling to right and down [3].

  Many wine builds, including the default wine-ge-8-26-x86_64 don't play the
  game's video tracks, and can even crash on playing the intro video, so the
  intro video has been disabled. You can re-enable it from the game's menu if
  you're using one of the wine builds that can play the videos (e.g. wine-10.7-staging-tkg-amd64 [4]).

  lanczos2-sharp shader is used for upscaling, select "Configure cnc-ddraw"
  from the game menu to pick another shader or apply other ddraw tweaks.

  The Hi-Res hack [5] is installed, but not applied out of the box, you can run
  it from the game's menu.

  Components used: wine x64 + cnc_ddraw + hi-res hack + native amstream and quartz [6]
