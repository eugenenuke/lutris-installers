description: |
  This version includes a fix for notorious "Insert CD" [1] and
  "Black Screen/No Briefing Videos" [2] issues, as well as an issue with
  scrolling to right and down [3].

  The default wine-ge-8-26-x86_64 still does't show the game's video tracks,
  use system's wine, proton or wine-10.7-staging-tkg-amd64 [4].

  lanczos2-sharp shader is used for upscaling, select "Configure cnc-ddraw"
  from Lutris' start menu to pick another shader or apply other ddraw tweaks.

  Components used: wine x64 + cnc_ddraw + native amstream and quartz [5]
