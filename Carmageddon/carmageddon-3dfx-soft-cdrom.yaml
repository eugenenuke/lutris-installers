notes: |
  This installation script requires you to have the game's CD.

  This installation script enables software-based 3Dfx support (3dfx Voodoo 1) [1].
  At the moment of writing (mid 2025), lutris is using doxbox-staging v0.80.1,
  but the software-based 3Dfx is available starting with v0.81.0, so you might
  need to define a custom binary for DoxBox in the game configuration section
  after installing the game.

  Press F11 in the game to switch the game's resolution.
