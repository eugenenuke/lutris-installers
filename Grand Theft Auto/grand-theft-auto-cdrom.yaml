  This installation script requires you to have the game's CD.

  This installation script does not enable any 3Dfx support, so the game's
  graphics is running on the CPU (==lower graphics quality). The good thing
  is that it should run on any version of DosBox.

  Press F11 in the game to switch the game's resolution.
