notes: |
  The GOG version of the game includes the "Silent Storm: Sentinels" expansion
  you can pick the game to start from the Lutris menu.

  DXVK (DirectX 9 to Vulkan wrapper) doesn't work with the GOG provided d3d9.dll,
  so its d3d9.dll is intentionally disabled (renamed) but DXVK is kept enabled.
